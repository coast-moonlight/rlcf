# Reinforcement Learning Communication Framework

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Reinforcement Learning Communication Framework (RLCF). The framework simulates communication among multiple robots executing tasks in a simulated environment.

## Overview

The Reinforcement Learning Communication Framework (RLCF) is designed to facilitate communication among multiple robots operating in a shared environment. The primary components of the framework include:

- **Robot Class**: Represents individual robots capable of executing tasks.
- **ReinforcementLearningCommunicationFramework Class**: Implements the communication framework, managing communication probabilities and evaluating communication metrics.
- **Simulation Function**: Conducts simulations of task execution and communication among robots.
- **Test Function**: Runs multiple simulations to test the performance of the RLCF.
- **Plotting Function**: Visualizes simulation results and metrics across multiple runs.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/RL_Communication_Framework.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, install required dependencies using pip:

    ```
    pip install simpy matplotlib numpy
    ```

3. **Run Simulations**: Execute the `test_rlcf()` function in the `rlcf.py` script to run simulations and evaluate the framework's performance. You can adjust simulation parameters as needed.

4. **View Results**: Simulation results and performance metrics will be printed to the console. Optionally, you can visualize metrics across multiple simulations by uncommenting the relevant section in the `__main__` block and executing the script.
